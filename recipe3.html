                <li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
                <li><strong>Boil the pasta:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).</li>
                        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes, until mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite.</li>
                        <li>Using a colander, drain and set to the side.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cook the ground beef:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef.</li>
                        <li>Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Add the butter and aromatics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef. Stir until all ingredients are combined.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Combine the pasta and ground beef:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine. Add the heavy whipping cream, chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese. Stir until combined.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Add to a casserole dish:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the remaining cheese.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and bubbly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Serve and store:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For a looser casserole, serve right away. For a casserole that holds its shape a bit, let sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
                        <li>The casserole will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.</li>
                        <li>You can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months. To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350°F until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you are reheating).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
